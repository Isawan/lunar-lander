Lunar lander
============

Hi, thanks for checking my submission of the lunar lander.


Aim
---
The aim of this game is to land the lunarlander from a height of 100m under constant gravitational acceleration 1m/s2
To land safely, you must touch down at a speed of less than 10m/s.
In addition you must also land the spacecraft the right way up.


Additional features
-------------------
In addition to the specified functionality, this game contains a number of features:
- 2D Rotation of the spacecraft
- Fuel loss effects the acceleration of the ship
- A fancy custom GUI
- Keyboard control

Controls
--------
The slider on the right allows you to control the thruster of the rocket.
Keyboard control allows control of the thruster and rotation.
- Use the up/down key to control the thruster
- Use the left/right key to control angular velocity of the ship


Running
-------
My lunar lander can be run with both python 2.7 or python 3.4.
However, please note that a required package 'pygame' is only installed in anaconda with python 2.7 on the university system and not 3.4.
